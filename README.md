# Northwind Database Analysis with SQL

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from the [Northwind database](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs), a classic dataset representing a fictional company, **Northwind Traders**, which operates in the food and beverage industry on an international scale.

This analysis is conducted using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), hosted within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment, to explore key **SQL** features. The goal is to answer critical business questions and extract actionable insights that can inform decision-making processes.

The insights derived from this project can serve as a model for other companies looking to generate meaningful reports and enhance their strategic decisions.
